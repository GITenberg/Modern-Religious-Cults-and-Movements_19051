description: 'First published in 1924, this title explores the schools of religious
  thought and practice that sprung up towards the end of the nineteenth century and
  at the start of the twentieth: sects, mystics and spiritualists, theological sciences
  and scientific theologies, personal philosophies, and a huge range of new trajectories
  of thought within the established forms of Western European Christianity. In particular,
  the author explores the numerous ways in which ''Eastern'' religious traditions,
  or at least spiritual patterns deriving inspiration from the Orient, gained a foothold
  among seek.'
